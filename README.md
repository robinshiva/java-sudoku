# Robindoku:

A sudoku app that I made as a practice project in javafx. It comes with basic functionality like writing down candidates as small numbers and the option to highlight a number if it does not fit. It includes a library of puzzles from the sudoku-exchange-puzzle-bank (https://github.com/grantm/sudoku-exchange-puzzle-bank)
